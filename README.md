# Endogenous_process_estimator

Here, I provide one R script file ("1. Main program") which contains the code to reproduce the simulation study presented in the manuscript "Accounting for Informative Monitoring Times under an Endogenous Covariate Process" of Coulombe, Moodie, Platt et Renoux (the main analysis, along with some alternative bits of code which can be used to change the parameters and to reproduce the different scenarios considered in the simulation study). That R code can be used to 1) Simulate a full dataset; and 2) compute the proposed estimators, as well as all other estimators we compared with them. 

A second R script file ("2. Bootstrap") contains the bootstrap code we used to compute bootstrap variance for all estimators we compared.
